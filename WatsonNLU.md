## Overview
Natural Language Understanding enables advanced text analysis through natural language processing. The service analyzes unstructured text to extract metadata such as entities, general concepts, keywords, categories, relations, sentiment, and emotion. 

## Node-RED Watson NLU node

The Node-RED ![](Images/nlu_node.jpg) Node provides an easy to use wrapper that you can extract meta-data from content. You can analyse external URLs, HTML files or text content.

## Watson NLU Flow Construction

In this exercise we will show you how to use the node to extract data from a webpage and simple text.

### Prerequisites and setup
To get the NLU service credentials on IBM Cloud automatically filled in by Node-RED, you should connect the NLU service to the Node-RED application.


## Building the Flow  
Add the following nodes from the palette to your flow canvas.
*	Two Inject nodes.
*	A Natural Language Understanding node.
* A Debug node.

### Flow Wiring
Wire the nodes together like so:
